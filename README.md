Sub-cellular-localization-in-cell
==================================================================
Objective
"To visualize biological cells and highlight by a user selected sub-cellular compartments in a way that they stand out from the un-selected ones" 
==================================================================
Input data
Remarks about input format:
a) Input data file should be either a ".txt" or ".csv" file.
b) Text file must contain proteins of only one type of cell.
c) File’s first line should contain cell type (i.e: eukaryota, archea, bacteria).
d) File's second line should contain Score (i.e: 0-100). Note: Minimum score should be zero.
e) File's third line should contain columns description (i.e: Protein Id, Score, Localization).
f) User’s file can have more than 3 columns but additional columns will not be executed.

Implementation
•	First, all the cell compartments were identified by the paths that were marked using the GIMP image editor.
•	The images of the different cell compartments were saved in svg file format.
•	Using the information from the user's input file, the number of proteins present in each compartment were determined.
•	Each compartment was highlighted using a localization color scale, which was obtained by converting the number of proteins present in each localization into a percentage and matched to a color.
•	We included a table to display all the proteins present in each cell compartment and their scores.
•	Upon 'mouseover' over a compartment, a tooltip was displayed, which shows the proteins present in that cell compartment, and the score (confidence) of the protein.
•	The proteins displayed in the tooltip were made clickable so that the cell image could be updated to reflect the scores of the protein in all the cell compartments.
•	Finally, the cell compartments were highlighted using a score color scale, which was obtained by mapping the score of a protein in each cell compartment to a color.

Description of color scale for localization and score

a)	Localization
The lightest color represents the minimum number of proteins in a cell compartment, in contrast, the darkest color represents the maximum number of proteins within a cell compartment. These values are also expressed in percentages where the lightest color matches with 0% and the darkest color with 100%.

a)	Score(confidence)
The color scale for score (confidence) is based on percentages from 0 to 100 % where 0 means low confidence and 100 means accurate confidence.
